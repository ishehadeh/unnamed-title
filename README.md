Dungeon Crawl Rogue like based on the card game Scoundrel

## Rules <a name="rules"></a>
### Setup:
Scoundrel is played with a standard deck of playing cards.

First, search through the deck and remove all of the Jokers, Red Face Cards and Red Aces. Place them off to the side as they are not used in this game.

Then shuffle the remaining cards and place the pile face down on your left. THis deck is called the **Dungeon**.

Take out a piece of paper and pen (or use your memory). Mark down 20 on the piece of paper, this is your starting **Health**.

### Rules:
The 26 **Clubs** and **Spades** in the deck are known as **Monsters**. Their damage is represented by the cards ordered value. (e.g. 10 = 10, Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13 and Ace = 14)

The 9 **Diamonds** in the deck are known as **Weapons**. Each weapon does as much damage as the cards listed value. All weapons in Scoundrel are Binding, meaning if you pick one up, you must equip it, and discard your previous weapon.

The 9 **Hearts** in the deck are known as **Health Potions**. You may only use one health potion each turn, even if you pull two. The second potion you pull is simply discarded. You may not restore your life beyond the starting 20 health.

The Game ends when either your life reaches 0 or you make your way through the entire **Dungeon**
